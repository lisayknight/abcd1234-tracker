## Design Rationale

‘Simmer & Sip’ is a web app that monitors caloric intake through soups. The general purpose of ‘Simmer & Sip’ is to help young adults, especially students, effortlessly maintain a healthy diet. Users are able to log soup recipes, including ingredients and macro nutrients. The nutritional information of the soup ingredients will be manually entered by the user. This is to encourage food education and health consciousness. There is also a section of the app to track ingredients the user has on hand. This allows for efficient food preparation and planning. 

### Iterations and Improvements

I have modified some of the web app layout compared to my intial wireframe proposals. Instead of having separate containers for all of the data inputs, I decided to go with one big container. This allows for simplicity and a more clean aesthetic. I spent a long time playing around with the colour palette and font sizes, as well as the larger container sizes and their ratios. The goal was to have a simple yet bold design that translated well between desktop and mobile use. This is due to my target audience being young adults who have busy schedules and are drawn to convenient user experiences. 

## Web App Functionality

The web app facilitates the management and tracking of soup recipes and fridge items through user-friendly forms. Users can select a task type from a dropdown menu to display the appropriate form for adding either soup recipes or fridge items. Upon form submission, the app captures and saves the entered data to Local Storage, ensuring persistence across sessions. Soup recipes include details like ingredients, cuisine, preparation time, calories, date, and notes, while fridge items record the ingredient name, food group, quantity, unit, and calories. The app dynamically updates the displayed forms and recent items list based on user input. Additionally, it provides functionalities for deleting items from the recent list or the fridge inventory, with updates reflected in both the user interface and Local Storage. The app ensures a seamless user experience by redirecting users to relevant pages upon form submission and loading stored data to populate lists and forms on page load.
